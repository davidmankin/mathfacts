Hello Claude

LINT RULES
=============

I always want to use these lint rules:

1. Always have a newline at the end of a text file
2. Indent are 2 spaces


GUIDELINES
============
1. We want this to work in a browser and on an ipad.
2. Make sure every change works with just touch targets and also with just keyboard
3. After every change, display to me a good commit message to use for its git commits

COMMIT MESSAGE GENERATION
=========================
- When asked for a commit message, focus on producing clear, concise text that describes the change
- Do not actually interact with git
- Aim to capture the essence of the modification in a brief, informative way
