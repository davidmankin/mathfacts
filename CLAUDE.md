Hello Claude

LINT RULES
=============

I always want to use these lint rules:

1. Always have a newline at the end of a text file
2. Indent are 2 spaces


GUIDELINES
============
1. We want this to work in a browser and on an ipad.
2. Make sure every change works with just touch targets and also with just keyboard
3. After every change, git commit with a brief description of the changes.
